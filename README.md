## Get started

First you need to install neu cli globally. Learn more about [Neutralino](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/).

```
npm install -g @neutralinojs/neu
# or
yarn global add @neutralinojs/neu 
```

You can get started with this project with following command.

```
npx degit alger23/neutralinojs-react-router-dom-boilerplate my-app
```

Then run 

`cd ./my-app`

and install dependencies

```
#restore neutralinojs files
neu update
# install dependencies 
yarn install
# or 
npm install
```

Then start 
```
yarn start
# or 
npm start
```

# neutralinojs-minimal
The simplest template for a Neutralinojs app. It's possible to use your favorite frontend framework using the following steps.

- Create a new project using your favorite frontend framework. (Eg: `ng new --directory .`)
- Make the frontend framework's build path and Neutralino config's `url`, `resourcesPath` the same.
- Build with the correct base href.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
